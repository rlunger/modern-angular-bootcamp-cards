# modern-angular-bootcamp-cards

I'm primarily a Java developer trying Angular/TypeScript for the first time.

This is my WIP implementation of the card component created in Section 3 of the Udemy course _The Modern Angular Bootcamp [2020]_ by Stephen Grider.

As ususal, I've tweaked the requirements and design to fit my own development preferences.
